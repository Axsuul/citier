**Ruby Class Inheritance & Multiple Table Inheritance Embeddings : A full featured solution based on Ruby Class Inheritance & Views**

When trying to model a real world problem that needs some information storage into databases, programmers often face the issue which consists in mapping objects to relational databases (see for instance here). After a short (and not exhaustive) review of Rails existing solutions we propose a new solution which has been bundled into a gem called : **CITIER** **C**lass **I**nheritance & **T**able **I**nheritance **E**mbeddings **For Rails**

This article is deeply inspired by [Multiple Table Inheritance with ActiveRecord by Maxim Chernyak](http://mediumexposure.com/multiple-table-inheritance-active-record/)
